admins = yournick, anyone, else, youwanttobe, anadmin (this will allow you to use permission checks in code)

use_ssl = false (server dependant)
port = portforserver (usually 6667 if ssl is false)

(the bot can sit in a bunch of different channels. 
Just be careful when setting it up, as it can announce things in the wrong channel if you're not careful).

nick_blocks = (anyone you want the bot to ignore?)
host_blocks = (any servers to ignore?)
exclude = (folders the bot should not load)
homedir = /home/bots/.sopel/ (whatever directory your bot files reside in)
db_filename = /home/bots/.sopel/$botnick.db (whatever your bot nick is makes it easier to find if you have multiple bots)
extra = /home/bots/.sopel/additionalModules (any folders of custom modules you'd like the bot to load as well. We have many.)
